## "WHISTLE!"

I recently started watching Ted Lasso AppleTV+ and got interested in ~~soccer~~ football. Basic, I know, but it is what it is. As I was reading up on "the beautiful game," trying to figure out just what the heck "offside" is, I also realized I could probably use this to practice data analytics and kill two birds with one stone. Even though Ted thinks "success is not about wins and losses," most ~~soccer~~ football (dang it) fans seem to erm...respectfully... disagree. :goal_net: :soccer:

## "Because if they were curious, they would have asked questions." :dart:

I originally found the data and initial questions for this project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-python-soccer), but actually downloaded the data on data.world, where the data dictionary is [located](https://data.world/chas/2018-2019-premier-league-matches/workspace/data-dictionary). I had to refer back to the data dictionary and several random websites to understand what all the fields meant, but I finally started to figure it out. DataCamp provided some prompts for analyzing this dataset, which I also found helpful:

- What team commits the most fouls?
- What percentage of matches in a draw?
- Does the number of red cards a team receives have an effect on its probability of winning a game?

## Butts on Three! 1...2...

NOTES:

- make a pie chart about league wins vs draws
- make some charts about Tottenham Hotspur
  - Home/Away wins/draws/losses pie charts
- write about why I chose Tottenham Hotspur
