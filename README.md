## WHISTLE!

I recently started watching Ted Lasso on an AppleTV+ trial and got interested in ~~soccer~~ football. Basic, I know, but it is what it is. As I was reading up on "the beautiful game", trying to figure out just what the heck "offside" is, I also realized I could probably use this to practice data analytics and kill two birds with one stone.

## Butts on Three! 1...2...

I originally found the data and initial questions for this project from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace/datasets/dataset-python-soccer), but actually downloaded the data on data.world, where the data dictionary is [located](https://data.world/chas/2018-2019-premier-league-matches/workspace/data-dictionary). I had to refer back to the data dictionary and several random websites to understand what all the fields meant, but I finally started to figure it out. DataCamp provided three prompts for analyzing this dataset, which I also found very helpful:

- What team commits the most fouls?
- Plot the percentage of games that ended in a draw over time.
- Does the number of red cards a team receives have an effect on its probability of winning a game?
